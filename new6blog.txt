The world has gone to waste and most of the population is dead or hostile. You are currently living in a small town called Ashtown that is attempting to rebuild civilization again. It's not there yet though.
You are a typical basement dweller, playing your Xbox and watching anime... or rather you used to be. When the internet was still in its infancy you used to watch it a lot and you would play games with your friends online. Due to recent events, you are currently half human.
[The adventure begins]
You and the space marine arrive at the Gloom: The Gloom is a semi-secret underground headquarters for the Shadow Horde, a non-corporeal "race" of undead who have somehow managed to keep most of their necromantic powers while being bound to this realm.
You and the space marine have entered combat with the Dark Order: This is a group of wizards who primarily use shadow magic. They all have pointy hats. The leader has a top hat decorated with a red plume, which he uses primarily for intimidation purposes. He is known as the Professor.
You then try attacking the Dark Order with your Transcendental Meditation of the Red Dragon [you are currently half human].
